# Angular Projects
A collection of small Angular projects to deepen my knowledge and inspire other junior developers to explore the framework.

## About
This repository includes a series of small projects I've built while learning Angular. Each project focuses on different aspects of the framework, from basic components and services to more advanced topics like routing, forms, and state management.

The goal is to learn by building â€” and to share that learning journey with others who are just starting with Angular.

## Projects
Hereâ€™s a list of some of the Angular projects in this repository:

- **Project 1 - Simple Task List**: A basic task list in Angular to understand the fundamentals of Angular.
- **Project 2 - Investment Calculator App**: Like a calculator, but a fun little project for "predicting" certain investments.

Feel free to explore each folder for detailed READMEs and instructions for each project.

## Installation
To try out any of these projects:

1. Clone the repository:
 
```git clone https://github.com/Hollow-Serenity/Angular-Project.git```

```cd Angular-Project```


Navigate to the project folder you want to explore:


```cd project-name```


Install dependencies:

```npm install```


Run the project:

```ng serve```


Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/ to see it in action.

##Why This Repo?
Angular can feel overwhelming when starting out. By working on small, focused projects, Iâ€™ve been able to gradually understand how different parts of Angular fit together. I hope this collection helps other developers feel more comfortable with Angular and inspires them to build their own projects!

##Contributing
